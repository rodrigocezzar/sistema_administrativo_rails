#### Complete administrative system using Rails Admin, in this example we are going to create a platform so that a company can manage the sales of its sales representatives with two types of user: manager and salesperson.

We will also learn to implement a series of useful features common to most APPs such as authentication using Devise, authorization using CanCanCan, filtering records based on who owns them, uploading photos, customizing their appearance and exporting data to PDF using graphics.
